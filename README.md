Instructions: https://github.com/SillyCatDev/Aurora-11-Lite/blob/main/Instructions.md

### DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if your system is bricked or breaks after installing this modification. Please check the contents of iso file using 7-Zip or go to the "ISO Files" folder in the github repos. Performance may vary on diffrent hardware. (x64 Architecture only!!)

### â€¢ Features
#### -Lightweight
Mostly all of the bloatware from Windows is removed and telemetry has been removed too. Some features are still in beta and may break so it's not recommended to use them. Updates are set to security only, so your device won't say "uPdATe aVAlIbLe, dOwnLoad nOw!1!1!!1" every 2 days
Some apps like Calculator, Photos, MS Store, Paint, Notepad are still included.
If you'd like to remove them, then there's a file for that too, you can get the script from ![here(https://github.com/SillyCatDev/Gelio-11/blob/main/Tweaks/Remove_Included_Applications.ps1)]

#### -All tracking, telemetry and crap is removed

#### -Microsoft services and bloatware removed (more customization of privacy with O&O shutup, get it from the script provided)

#### -Sponsored apps and Sponsored Adverts / Content also removed. So your apps list wont have "RAIDSHADOWDARKLEGENDS" or "CANDY CRUSH ULTIMATE SAGA!!!!" xD

#### -Gaming and performance improvements (May not improve on all hardware)
Windows uses a "priority" system as for "Which apps should get the most allowance of systme resources", by default all proccesses (except system ones) will have the "Default" Priority. The "Priority System" is modified to set any game or editing software processes' priority to "Above normal", you can do this through the task manager, this is automated here. Increase in FPS may also be noticeable, video memory is pre-allocated to allow applications to use it directly, which can improve FPS.

#### -Script to fix Windows 11 Explorer (uses Valinet's [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/)), and get that control back over your privacy (uses [O&O ShutUp 10++](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10.))
