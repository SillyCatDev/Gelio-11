### â€¢ Features
#### -Lightweight
Mostly all of the bloatware from Windows is removed and telemetry has been removed too. Some features are still in beta and may break so it's not recommended to use them. Updates are set to security only, so your device won't say "uPdATe aVAlIbLe, dOwnLoad nOw!1!1!!1" every 2 days
Some apps like Calculator, Photos, MS Store, Paint, Notepad are still included.
If you'd like to remove them, then there's a file for that too, you can download it from GitHub (Scripts folder)

#### -All tracking, telemetry and crap is removed

#### -Microsoft services and bloatware removed (i.e. Office Hub, Microsoft 365, etc.., only exception is Microsoft Store, left if you want to use it)

#### -Sponsored apps and Sponsored Adverts / Content also removed. So your apps list wont have "RAIDSHADOWDARKLEGENDS" or "CANDY CRUSH ULTIMATE SAGA!!!!" xD

#### - k u s t o m   w a l l p a p e r   (ig it counts as a feature)

#### -Gaming and performance improvements (May not improve on all hardware)
Windows uses a "priority" system as for "Which apps should get the most allowance of systme resources", by default all proccesses (except system ones) will have the "Default" Priority. The "Priority System" is modified to set any game or editing software processes' priority to "Above normal", you can do this through the task manager, this is automated here. Increase in FPS may also be noticeable, video memory is pre-allocated to allow applications to use it directly, which can improve FPS. If you find that there's a decrease in FPS and not an increase, please report it in the "Issues" tab in GitHub or send me a dm on discord: $CmdShell#8830

#### -Minor life of quality tweaks (You must run a script to enable these tweaks, they can be found in "Tweaks" as "LoQ_Tweaks.ps1" or "LoQ_Tweaks.cmd"
